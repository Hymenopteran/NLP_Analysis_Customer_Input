# NLP Analysis of Free-Form Customer Survey Responses


# Executive Summary

Hiscox USA is the leading small business insurance carrier in the United States and serves thousands of customers with essential specialty insurance products such as Cyber, Professional Liability, General Liability, and Business Owner policies. Sales occur across all customer channels including direct agent and digital mediums (desktop and mobile). To improve the customer experience, the company utilizes Feefo to collect quantitative data and free text feedback at the conclusion of a customer's interaction with Hiscox. The marketing team is interested in sentiment analysis associated with customer reviews and what contributes to those ratings. I performed quantitative Natural Linguistic Programming analyses. The findings were as follows:

Finding 1. Over 95% of customer reviews were positive in both score and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, these high ratings are consistent year-over-year. However, without knowing the total number of surveys being sent to customers, we cannot know if these results are a representative sample of all customer experiences.

Finding 2. Discrepancies do exist between some Star score ratings and the actual language from the corresponding review, but do not constitute a significant number of responses. Furthermore, there are very few (â‰ˆ5%) where CoreNLP scores differ markedly from Star rankings.

Finding 3. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I found the top two to three ideas -- both positive and negative -- that resonate with a plurality of survey respondents. Year over year results show a consistent enthusiasm for Hiscox's customer service but suggest occasional issues with payment systems, agent timeliness and policy changes.
